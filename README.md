# Intermittent Next.js Link Errors

This repository demonstrates a problem where Next.js links intermittently fail, resulting in blank pages or 404 errors. The issue is not consistently reproducible, making it challenging to debug.

## Bug Description

Links within the application sometimes work perfectly, other times they lead to blank pages or 404 errors, despite having correctly defined paths.  The behavior is not consistent, making it difficult to identify the root cause.

## Reproduction Steps

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
3. Run `npm run dev` to start the development server.
4. Navigate between pages using the links provided. Note that the failure is inconsistent; it may not happen immediately.

## Potential Causes

* **Incorrect Routing Configuration:** Check your `pages` directory structure and `next.config.js` file for any misconfigurations.
* **Client-Side Routing Issues:**  Examine the client-side rendering process to ensure that links are handled correctly.
* **Asynchronous Issues:**  Look for any asynchronous operations that might affect link rendering.
* **Caching:** Investigate if caching mechanisms are interfering with link functionality.
